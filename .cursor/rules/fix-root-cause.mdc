# Your rule content

- Important: try to fix things at the cause, not the symptom.
- [index.html](mdc:index.html) is the stating point
- [styles.css](mdc:styles.css) is where all the site styles is defined
- [map-layer-controls.js](mdc:map-layer-controls.js) has the main UI component to handle build the list of toggleable layers and control its interaction

This is the technology stack to use:
- Mapbox GL JS for client side map rendering and interactivity
- jQuery for easy DOM manipulation
- Shoelace for UI components. Mainly used for [map-layer-controls.js](mdc:map-layer-controls.js)
- tailwindcss for responsive CSS framework
